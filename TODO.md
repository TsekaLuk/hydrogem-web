# HydroGem Water Monitoring System - Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the development roadmap for the HydroGem water quality monitoring system. The system is designed to provide comprehensive monitoring and management of water quality across various water bodies, devices, and geographical areas. The development will focus on enhancing existing components and implementing new features to support flexible management of water areas, watersheds, and regional areas.

## Core Design Principles

- **Flexible Hierarchical Structure**: Support both complete hierarchical structures for large water management systems and simplified structures for smaller water bodies
- **Dual-Direction Data Flow**: Enable both top-down (region → watershed → water area → device → parameter) and bottom-up (parameter → device → water area → watershed/region) data flows
- **Data Isolation and Aggregation**: Ensure proper data isolation between different regions while allowing data aggregation at higher levels
- **Responsive and Clean UI**: Focus on presenting critical information clearly with minimal visual clutter

## UI Component References

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Apply Cuicui's visual hierarchy principles to ensure the most important information is immediately visible and accessible
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet Material UI's accessibility standards, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast requirements
- **State Management**: Follow HeroUI's patterns for handling loading, error, and empty states consistently across the application

> **CRITICAL NOTE:** A dedicated document with comprehensive guidance on applying these component standards has been created at `src/docs/ComponentStandards.md`. All developers must read this document before implementing new components.

## Notes & Considerations

1. **Small Water Body Support**: Ensure that the design supports management of small water bodies (e.g., fish ponds) without requiring the full hierarchical structure.

2. **Performance with Large Deployments**: Consider performance optimizations for systems managing hundreds or thousands of devices across multiple regions.

3. **Offline Support**: Design components to gracefully handle intermittent connectivity issues from devices.

4. **Data Consistency**: Ensure consistent calculation of derived metrics across different views and aggregation levels.

5. **Extensibility**: Design components and data models to allow for future extensions without significant refactoring.
